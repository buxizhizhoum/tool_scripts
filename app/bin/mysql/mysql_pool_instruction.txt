When connection pool is used, a connection is get from the pool, and it is
add to the pool when used.
There are 3 method to keep the connection pool is full:
    1. conn.close()
    2. self.pool.add_connection()
    3. self.pool.add_connection(conn._cnx)
    The method 1, finally cause the add_connection function, and add the
    conn._cnx connection to the pool, so method 1 and method 3 is almost
    the same.
    Method 2 just add a new connection share the same config info with
    other connections, so if this method is used, the connection will be
    refreshed one by one when in usage.
    And method 2 is slightly faster than the other 2, reason is not
    clear so far.
